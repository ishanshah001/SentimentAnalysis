Either way how I see BG3 stand out compared to it's peers is a combination of two things, firstly there's the Larian patented physics/world reactivity and the verticality that comes from it. Problems can be solved with so many ways with the toolsets given, that at times it steps into the realm of immersive sims.

Then other thing is the reactivity of the world and characters, they have put up so many failsaves and reactions to things that it's possible to have multiple playthroughs that are very different from eachother.

But hopefully we get a little break and when they come back for another Spider-Man game down the road do think they will have been able to innovate enough and make enough new things to do in New York that it will feel fresh or will coming back to New York possibly hurt it? Could they do another Spider-Man game that takes place in an all new city? What would a spidey story look like in say madripoor, wakanda, asteroid M/Genosha/krakoa, Attilan?? I think when we get a new Spider-Man game a story that takes him out of his home and puts him in a new unfamiliar city environment would be really fun. Now that their expanding insomniacs marvel world with wolverine I think it would be great to also utilize the vast stock of other marvel villains to put Spider-Man against, that would also help to freshen it up rather than sticking to the same rogues gallery that Spider-Man games have been using for years.","12"

Oh well, lesson learned.  Just going to make sure that any game I buy from now on at the $70+ price point lists a minimum of 40 hours to complete, I preordered a couple months ago and only saw the reviews saying even as little as 20 hours to complete the day of launch.  Guess this is my reckoning for preordering.  I've preordered 50+ games and always got what I was expecting, this one just ended up not being worth it.","34_3_1"

But the lack of exclusive games is a joke, if they have any hope of recovering this gen they have to start putting out good exclusives, and they havent proven they can do that yet. 

Im still worried about the direction Sony wants to go with live service, making teams like Naughty Dog work on multiplayer games and remasters only, that stuff isnt looking good imo.

I had a Series X until a few weeks ago but sold it. The main reasons I turned it on was to play MG Rising and Sonic Racing Transformed - two 360 games, and SSX3, which came out 20 years ago this Saturday. They make great hardware, but everything else about them as a videogame company is just horrible.

You reckon Sony's output has dried up the same week Spider-Man 2 launches?","12_1_1_1_2_1_1"

I do like Gamepass, I just got to play Lies of P and Starfield and I didnt but either, but its not always this good. It has been decent this year imo.

And yeah Id say things have been drying up for Sony, the two big exclusives we got this year are Spider-man 2 and FF16 right (and I was lukewarm on FF16 honestly)? No news from Naughty Dog, I guess we got HZW DLC which was, kinda meh. I dont count TLOU Part 1 as like a new game, that was a remaster they called a remake and charged full price for, I got it on special recently and yeah incredible graphics but ridiculous to charge full price for that.

Im not saying Xbox is doing better far from it, Im comparing now to when we were getting game after game it seemed, we we constantly getting PS5 upgrades of games, which kept things fresh (like GOT for example). This year has been dry to me Im just being honest, Spider-man 2 is going to insane no doubt Im talking about the rest of the year and going forward things seem to have sloan down imo. And this change in strategy with a bunch of live service games is a red flag to me. How can we have Naughty Dogs, one of the best single player devs on earth, making a live service multiplayer game? Which is now delayed because theres issues with it. Strange decision making imo, we should be talking about TLOU 3 instead we might get Factions next year who knows when the next real Naughty Dog game comes out , it might not even be this gen, when TLOU2 came out nearly 4 years ago now.","12_1_1_1_2_1_1_1"

You are welcome to your views on gamepass, but I dont find subscription models good for gamers or developers (been a developer for 15 years now - who has also worked on products ME has bought). 

Lets face it, a couple of inferior generations are not the reason. They are the effect. The UX/UI of those consoles were not up to scratch (for players or devs) and the software they produce has just not been able to compete with the quality of Sony or Nintendo. Xbox is mostly surviving due to an evangelical American following.","12_1_1_1_2_1_2_1_1"

Im no fan of either company btw, I see them both as just another massive corporation that if they could would do everything in their power to be as anti consumer as possible.

The consoles this gen perform almost identically to one another it was last gen that Xbox One was inferior and it cost $100 more due to Kinect which was a massive failure. Xbox was already in second place despite a very good gen during 360, but its really as simple as a lot of people refused to pay more for a worse product, and last gen was where most people built their digital library.

This gen the consoles are very much on par and in some ways the Series X is actually better in terms of features like FPS Boost and Backwards Compatibility.

And yeah Xboxs majority market is the US, but Sonys majority market is Japan, if you took either one of these markets away it would decimate either company.

Xbox isnt going anywhere, even if they move away from making console hardware they will absolutely dominate cloud gaming, which will likely be massive in the future. Also remember Xbox is backed by Microsoft who can literally print money, they can afford to lose money, essentially light it on fire for years and it wouldnt even make a dent for them, Microsoft compared to Sony is not comparable in any way. So its a combination of Xbox still having a relatively okay market share of 30% or so, plus the backing of Microsoft. Like they arent clinging to life at all, the subscription revenue alone makes them worth it for Microsoft because subscription revenue is excellent for accounting purposes for any company. Thats why the push GamePass so hard.

And yeah theres certainly a conversation about how GamePass affects devs, much like Netflix negatively affects filmmakers and actors, but for the end consumer subscriptions are great. Theres a reason Sony is doing one too, its a good business model, and its the way things are going whether we like it or not.","12_1_1_1_2_1_2_1_1_1"

I will say if you haven't played the first two, as much as it would hurt to pause the current experience I would do that.

 I don't wanna spend $70 for a weekend. I wanna spend $70 for a whole full week of gameplay, but Rick makes a good point as well. It being short and good enough to make you want to replay it multiple times can make it worth it. Which for me rn is an issue cuz there's no ng+ which is the only reason I'd want to replay any game.

And nah no need to call you a no life, some people are able to grind games quickly, be it because they got the time or because they like to play games in one sitting/one weekend etc. I respect it. 

Back during my university days I was able to occasionally do that, but these days I pace myself. Not because I want to but because so much gets in the way and gaming is now a fun escape for me so I tend to stretch my plays out nicely as a sort of delayed gratification :)

While we are on the platinum subject though, Days Gone was my first Platinum. TLOU: PS5 Remaster &amp; TLOU 2 followed. I don't think I will get it for Cyberpunk however. It is the longest game I have ever played and filled with content throughout. That's why I love it though. Beyond well worth the money.
